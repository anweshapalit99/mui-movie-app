# mui-movie-app

A simple application built using MUI and React.

To run it locally one can fork the repo and then clone it or directly clone the repo using <code>git clone repo_name</code> the repo and then run 
<code>npm run preview</code>

The app is hosted using github pages and can be found here https://anweshapalit99.github.io/mui-movie-app/

P.S : A lot of inline styles using the MUI library should be present in the code, the presence of it is acknowledged, and I plan to move them seperately in later commits.
